### Hi there!

This is the archive of the Web3 Foundation's Grants Program. In this organisation, you will find all repositories 
that have ever been submitted as part of a grant. For simplicity, the repositories _usually_ have the same name 
as the original. However, due to the occasional name collision, we might rename the fork to something like 
`teamName-repoName`. 

If you do find an original repository deleted and cannot find a fork here, please [let us know](mailto:grants@web3.foundation).

If you want to apply for a grant or are looking for the main repository of the Grants Program, see 
[w3f/Grants-Program](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program).
